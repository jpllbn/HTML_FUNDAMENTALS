# HTML_FUNDAMENTALS
 
 **HTML** is the basic language used to create webpages. It uses **tags** to tell the browser how to display content, like text, images, and links. These tags are placed inside angle brackets, like `<p>` for paragraphs or `<h1>` for headings. The structure of an HTML page includes a `<head>` for behind-the-scenes info and a `<body>` where the visible content goes. HTML is like the skeleton of a webpage, helping organize everything you see online.
