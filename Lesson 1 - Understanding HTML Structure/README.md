### Lesson 1: Understanding HTML Structure
**Concept:** HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the structure or skeleton of web pages. Each part of a webpage is created using HTML tags. These tags define different types of content, like paragraphs, headings, images, and links.

**Explanation:**

- `<!DOCTYPE html>`: Tells the browser you're using HTML5.
- `<html>`: The root of the webpage.
- `<head>`: Contains metadata and the title.
- `<body>`: The content visible on the webpage.
- `<h1>`: A heading.
- `<p>`: A paragraph of text.
